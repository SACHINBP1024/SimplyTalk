# SimplyTalk üì±üó£Ô∏è

**SimplyTalk** is an innovative mobile application designed to transcribe external conversations and public announcements in real-time, particularly catering to the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. 

## Project Synopsis üìã

SimplyTalk focuses on places where important public information is announced, such as railways, airports, and other public venues. Additionally, it offers a conversation mode for everyday social interactions. The app is tailored to minimize the text, simplifying complex speech into digestible, fast, and efficient readable content, ensuring a smoother user experience.

## Objective üéØ

- To provide a solution that bridges communication gaps for the deaf community.
- To make public announcements more accessible.
- To simplify and accelerate reading by processing information quickly and clearly.

## Modes of Operation üö¶

1. **Travel Mode**: Designed for places with public announcements like railways, airports, and bus terminals. This mode efficiently transcribes important audio announcements, highlighting the relevant information for easy reading.
2. **Conversation Mode**: This mode transcribes real-time conversations between individuals, simplifying them to enable quick and clear understanding.

## Key Features üåü

- **Text Simplification**: A built-in lightweight language model will process and simplify text to be concise and easy to read.
- **Language Processing**: The app or device will support multilingual inputs, automatically detecting and transcribing speech in various languages.
- **Mini LLM Model Implementation**: By integrating a miniature large language model (LLM) within the wearable device, the app will be able to process and simplify text locally, without needing constant access to online resources.

## Multilingual Support üåê

SimplyTalk will support multiple languages, making it versatile for different regions, ensuring inclusivity for all communities worldwide.

## Indian Sign Language (ISL) Integration ü§ü

SimplyTalk will also support ISL, making it accessible for a wide range of people who are illiterate.

## Wearable Technology Integration ‚åö

To enhance portability and convenience, SimplyTalk could evolve into a wearable device, like smart glasses or a wristband. This wearable version would transcribe conversations and announcements, further simplifying interaction by freeing up hands. The wearability would make the app more practical, especially in travel settings.

## Potential Benefits üéÅ

- Accessibility for the deaf community, making public transportation and social interactions more inclusive.
- Easier and faster comprehension through simplified, minimal text.
- Multilingual transcription capabilities, ensuring use across diverse communities.
- Increased convenience via a wearable form factor for hands-free, on-the-go access.
- Integrated Indian Sign Language for easily accessible for illiterate people.
